# Age Calculator (React.JS + Vite)

Created an Age Calculator application using React.js and Vite, designed to determine the age or interval between two dates. Users can input their date of birth to calculate their age in years. The app features a clean, user-friendly interface that provides accurate age calculations based on the entered date. Leveraging Vite for rapid development and React for responsive updates, this project showcases effective date handling and user input processing.
